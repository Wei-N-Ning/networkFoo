Finally there is the issue of datagram size.
The theoretical maximum size of a UDP datagram is slightly less than 64KB.
However many UNIX hosts will only support a maximum near 32KB.
# NOTE {
For comparison, here is the size of a json blob:
oz app dump --av=athenaPlugins-1.13.1 | wc -c
3865 (bytes) ~ 3KB

}
