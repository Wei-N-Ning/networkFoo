Networking for system admin L136

A host network conf includes its IP addresses and gateway.
On unix, use the route and ifconfig cmd to view the system's 
network config.

(linux tool evolution) ifconfig -> ip, ethtool

a minimal install of CentOS doesn't include ifconfig, but it
is in the net-tools package

netstat
displays a system's established network connections, 

route
both displays where the system sends traffic and gives you 
the ability to change how the system delivers traffic.

tcpdump and wireshark
tcpdump command displays traffic to and from a server, even 
when the server rejects that traffic.
tcpdump is the fastest way to view network activity
for more complicated analysis, use wireshark

netcat
listen to the network on a specific port; lets you send arbitrary network traffic 
it's a great way to verify that the network will let you 
send and receive traffic without configuring a specific 
daemon or service for that purpose.

traceroute
a network is a collection of linked devices that pass traffic 
between hots, 
most networks can use a variety of routes between hosts.
shows you the route that traffic takes and where these links break.

host (preferred on linux), nslookup (MS)
or dig or drill
let you seek at the domain name service, which maps host 
names to IP addresses.
