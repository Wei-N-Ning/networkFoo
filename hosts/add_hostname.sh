# motivation:
# I have launched a couple of new Vmware vms, how can I ssh to
# them using their hostname (instead of ip addr)?

# source: https://unix.stackexchange.com/questions/55691/how-to-add-an-ip-to-hostname-file
# sudo vim /etc/hosts
# <ip addr> <hostname>

# FQDN
# note, hostname such as u18design is referred to as the
# unqualified name; whereas u18design.canva.com is the fully
# qualified domain name

# TLD
# top level domain 

# Domains
# below (to the left of) TLD

# Sub-domain
# below (to the left of) the domain
# design.ny.us.canva.com
