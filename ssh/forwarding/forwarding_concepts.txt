SSH definitive 2nd P/369
for complete application level transparency, you need a network-
level technique, such as IPSEC or a VPN in host software or dedicated 
routers.

while VPN provide a more complete solution, they require signifcantly
more work and expense to set up compared to SSH forwarding.

/////////
SSH forwarding techniques are to allow otherwise prohibited traffic 
across firewalls
the firewall prevents unauthorized traffic, while ssh forwarding allows
authorized users to bypass the restriction
don't forget you are bypassing a security restriction that is in place 
for a reason
just because you can do something does not automatically mean that it is 
a good idea.

what is forwarding
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
is a type of interaction with another network application
ssh intercepts a service request from some other program on one side 
of an ssh connection, sends it across the encrypted connection and 
delivers it to the intended recipient on the other side
this process is mostly transparent to both sides of the ocnnection:
each believes it is talking directly to its partner and has no knowledge 
that forwarding is taking place.

the paradiagm of agent forwarding holds treu for TCP port forwarding 
and X forwarding, as the ssh server transparently masquerades as 
another network application.

SSH definitive 2nd P/371
port forwarding is sometimes called tunneling because the SSH connection 
provides a secure tunnel through which another tcp/ip connection may 
pass.

with ssh port forwarding, you can transparently reroute the connection 
found on server S's tcp port xx to pass through ssh, securely 
encrypting the data over the connection. 
the server machine must be running an ssh server for port forwarding 
to provide real protection.

ssh port fowarding protects arbitrary tcp ip connections by redirecting 
them through an ssh session
