SSH definitive 2nd P/369
for complete application level transparency, you need a network-
level technique, such as IPSEC or a VPN in host software or dedicated 
routers.

while VPN provide a more complete solution, they require signifcantly
more work and expense to set up compared to SSH forwarding.

/////////
SSH forwarding techniques are to allow otherwise prohibited traffic 
across firewalls
the firewall prevents unauthorized traffic, while ssh forwarding allows
authorized users to bypass the restriction
don't forget you are bypassing a security restriction that is in place 
for a reason
just because you can do something does not automatically mean that it is 
a good idea.
