# Gateway

in the corporate world, companies commonly require all outgoing
connections to pass through a proxy server or `gateway` host:
a machine connected to both the company network and the outside.

Although connected to both networks, a gateway host doesn't act
as a router and the networks remain separated. Rather it allows
limited, application level access between two networks.
