# NAT:
# It enables private IP networks that use unregistered IP 
# addresses to connect to the Internet. NAT operates on a 
# router, usually connecting two networks together, and 
# translates the private (not globally unique) addresses in 
# the internal network into legal addresses, before packets 
# are forwarded to another network.
