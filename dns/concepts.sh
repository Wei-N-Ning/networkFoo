# DNS runs on TCP and UDP, using port 53 on both
# every network needs a DNS server, also called a nameserver, 
# to gather this information for you.

# a nameserver is a piece of software that searches for and 
# collects address and hostname mappings. Whenever you visit 
# a web page your computer makes a DNS request to a 
# nameserver. The nameserver checks its local cache to see if 
# it already has an answer. If the nameserver has a cached
# answer it sends the information to the client,
# if the nameserver does not have that info it queries the 
# Internet to get an answer
