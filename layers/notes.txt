networking for systems admins, L207

they are divided into several logical layers for convenience
and simplicity. Each layer handles a very specific task 
and usually interacts only with the layers immediately 
above and below it

when a (network) layer breaks, it takes all the layers above 
with it. Diagnosing a network problem requires first 
identifying the lowest layer that has a problem. 

a trouble ticket that says, here's the diagnostic output that shows a layer3 problem, but layer2 works fine, will get a much better response.

the layered network model is often called a network stack or the TCP/IP stack.


academic: OSI 7 layer model

modern networks: TCP/IP model

to understand the modern internet-attached network you need only 5 layers:
physical, datalink, network, transport and application
    1       2         3           4            5

the physical layer traditional has no intelligence, the datalink layer determines how it is used.

the datalink layer transforms the networks' upper layers into the signals transmitted over the wire; a single lump of datalink data is called a frame.
# NOTE:
ethernet belongs to this layer
see: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ethernet
Ethernet provides services up to and including the data link layer.

MAC address: Media Access Control address
IPv4: MAC, ARP
IPv4: MAC, ND 

layer 3 (network) maps connectivity between hosts.
this is where the system answers question: how do I get to this other host? can I get to this other host?

the network layer provides a consistent interface to network programs, so they can use the network over any physical and datalink layers. A single chunk of network data is called a packet.

the internet uses the internet protocol (IP) -> the IP in TCP/IP; 

layer 4 transport, a piece of transport layer data is a segment. 
3 most common transport layer protocols: ICMP (internet control message proto), TCP (transmission control proto), user datagram proto (UDP)

the next 3 layers are session, presentation and application. 

the session layer: opening, using an closing transport layer connections. 

the presentation layer lets progs exchange data with on another, 

the TCP/IP model calls everything above the transport layer the application layer, 
including protocols: HTTP, SMTP, LDAP

L270
your browser takes your request, gets the ip address for the site and asks the operating system for a connection to that IP address on TCP port 80

the transport layer in the operating system kernel takes 
the request and slices it into chunks small enough to fit 
inside TCP segments (536 bytes or smaller). It hands these 
segments down to the network layer.

the network layer only cares about where that segment needs to go. If the network layer knows how to reach the destination address, it wraps
each segment with IP information to create a packet and hands
the packet off to the datalink layer.

the datalink layer doesn't know about IP addresses, let alone browsers. It only knows
how to launch packets at a particular MAC address at the other end of 
a piece of wire.
The datalink layer adds information for the physical protocol to the packet,
creating a frame and sends it across the wire.

the wire carries the frame to the dest, where the target computer trips off the layers, reassembles the request, and hands it 
upt to the web server. The web server processes the request
and returns a response, which takes the same journey back.

one of the jobs of a router is to strip a frame's datalink information for one physical layer and add the datalink for a new physical layer before sending on the packet

L280
Layer, Tools
1 (phy) link light, ipconfig/ifconfig, cable replacement
2 (dl)  arp, ND, tcpdump
3 (nt)  ping, traceroute
4 (tp)  netstat, netcat, tcpdump
5+      logs, debuggers

narrow down the problem: the server has a link light on this 
connection but I'm not getting an ARP reply from the gateway.

L302
// troubleshooting physical layer //

phy layer offers two troubleshooting interface: interface commands and link lights.
(disconnected on Windows)
ifconfig: display link status
ethtool (linux only): 

always chop a failed cable in half before discarding it.

L323
// datalink troubleshooting //

arp: lists the other ethernet addresses that your operating
system sess on the network.
arp tables only shows ethernet address that should appear on your 
configured IP address range
use tcpdump to see what traffic the host receives from the 
network

// network layer troubleshoot //
when the network layer fails your host cannot deliver packets
to hosts beyond the local subnet; use ping and traecroute.

// transport layer troubleshoot //
netstat to view established connections;
netcat: to see if you can transmit data to another host
tcpdump: see if data arrives at your server and verify your host is actually sending data


Chapter 2: Ethernet.

L343
ehternet is a broadcast protocol.... either your network core, the server's network card or the card's device driver 
separates out data intended for your system from the data
meant for other systems.

a section of ethernet where all the hosts can communicate directly with 
each other without involving a route, is called a brodcast domain,
a segment, or a local area network (LAN)

every device on an ethernet needs a unique identifier, called a MAC address (48 bit long),
or ethernet address. 
the first six numbers of the MAC address identifies the ethernet card manufacturer

speed and duplex
L364
duplex: how each end handles transmitting and receiving data. An interface
running at half duplex can either receive or transmit data 
at any instance but not both. 
For a connection to work well, both sides must agree on
speed and duplex. (it won't work if server speaks 1Gbps, 
but the switch insists on 100Mbps)
if they disagree on duplex, the connection might appear to 
work but will lose frames under load.

modern equipment auto-negotiates connection speed and duplex,
 agreeing on the fastest settings both sides support. 

the protocol speed effectively says both sides speak the same 
language, but not how fast each side can actually exchange 
traffic.

what happens when a packet is too large for the datalink layer's frame: it fragments that data into pieces it can manage.
when the data reachs the destination, the dest system 
reassembles those fragments into a complete unit.
fragmentation increases load on both the server and the cl.

MTU: most systems set a /Maximum Transimission Unit/, the 
largest size that can fit through the datalink layer.
older ethernet: 1500 bytes
100Mbs ethernet: 9001-byte jumbo frames
# NOTE: observe the MTU value on CA's dev.jump host, which is 9001


Chapter 3: IPv4

L624
to connect a host to a network it needs a valid IP address 
and a subnet mask.
if it needs to communicate with hosts beyond the local network, 
it needs a default gateway.
knowing the addresses of your DNS servers is a definite 
plus

L654
length in bits: a netmask is the number of fixed bits in the 
local network. 
A/25 network has 25 fixed bits.

# NOTE:
run nc -l -u 192.168.0.14 32345
and nc -l -u localhost 32345 
observe the open file list:
lsof -p <pid>
the first form accepts remote connection;
the second form only accepts local/lo connection;
in comparison, running the perl oneliner UDP server, it 
accepts any addresses on the host:
perl5.18 81226 weining    3u  IPv4 0x7993effe0b4c8565        0t0     UDP *:32345
therefore it receives text sent to both localhost and the 
local subnet address

private addresses and NAT
you can't just grab random addresses for your private network, 
your random addresses are probably in use elsewhere on the 
internet, and if you use them on your private network you 
won't be able to communicate with that remote network.

various internet bodies have set aside three subnets for 
use on private networks.
you can not use them on the public internet, but anybody 
can use them on a private network.
10.0.0.0/8
172.16.0.0/12
192.168.0.0/16

L831
Network Address Translation: NAT, rewrites packets in flight, 
when a host with a private IP addresses sends traffic through 
a NAT device, the NAT device rewrites the outbound traffic 
so that it appears to be coming from the NAT device device's public IP address 
When the remote site answers, the NAT device rewrites the 
response so that it goes to the original client.
the NAT device maintains a table of connections, and tracks 
the state of each connection so that it can properly open 
and close connections as needed. 
Most home routers are NAT devices.

A firewall is most often som combination of packet filter, 
proxy server and NAT. 

Proxies, NAT devices and firewalls are not "Internet security
systems". They are components in an organization's security 
policy, but the devices on their own are merely points of 
policy enforcement.

Chapter 5: TCP/IP

L993
the word segment isn't used very often,
instead you will see references to a UDP or TCP package, which 
means an individual segment wrapped in an IP packet.

the IP packet contains vital information, like the source and 
destination IP addresses. Think of a segment like a fast-food 
hamburger in wax paper. IF a cashier dropped a fresh hot 
burger, unwrapped, straight in your hand, you'd consider it 
incomplete.

L1013
UDP is called connectionless because a UDP data "stream"
is not really a stream: it is a whole bunch of independent 
packets that just happen to be travelling in the same 
direction. 

L1034
three way handshake (on connection)
> one host requests a connection
> dest host either accepts, rejects or ignores the req
> if dest accepts, it sends back info on how to connect
> when the first host acknowledges the receipt of that info,
